## CouchDB 1.2.1 Application Wrapper for Mac OS X

### Build Instructions

Run [build-couchdb](https://github.com/cloudnode/build-couchdb) to do a fully automated build of the recent CouchDB 1.2.1 version. Copy the resulting 'build' folder into your home directory as ~/build. Launch Xcode and build this app.

### Downloads

Github does not allow hosting of binary files anymore. The [old download page](https://github.com/cloudnode/couchdbx-app/downloads) with CouchDB version 1.2 is still up.

Newer builds are available from our Gitweb site.
 
See [Downloads](http://gitweb.cloudno.de/downloads) for a pre-compiled CouchDB 1.2.1 version for Mac OS X.

### Install

Unzip and place CouchDB Server into the Applications directory.
